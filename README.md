# Hello! My name is Jesus Alberto.

## Who am I?

I am a reckless life-long learner with a college degree of Bachelor in Health and Safety.
But I'm in love with technology, so I'm self-taught into Python and its environment :snake:.

## Skills

My principal skills are related to writing, research, translating, resuming and analytic thinking; but truly, I've always been eager to learn something new.

### Here you can see my favorite languages
